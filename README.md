# autoftp â€” Fast remote development over FTP

Auto-send matching files over the network with FTP.  Watches for changes in files with matching names in the current directory and all subdirectories, quickly sending them by FTP to a remote server.  While this works with any files and remote FTP server, it is ideal for network-connected microcontroller development.  Matching files can optionally be processed with a script.

## Quick Start

```
% pip install colorama watchdog
% autoftp host
```

Install the [`uftpd.py`](https://github.com/robert-hh/FTP-Server-for-ESP8266-ESP32-and-PYBD) micro-FTP server on your micro-controller, and set it up to run on boot (see below for tips).

Install the [`autoftp`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdtsmith/autoftp/master/autoftp.py) file and run it like you normally run your Python3 scripts. 

To use, just run in a directory like `autoftp host`.  `autoftp` will start monitoring for changes in any `.py` files (by default) in the local directory or below, sending the files via an actively maintained FTP session to `host` whenever they are created or modified, and creating any sub-directories as needed. 

## Usage

```
Usage: autoftp ftphost -d --include=|-p --exclude=|-x --process=|-s --updelete|-k
  ftphost: FTP host to connect to
  -d: Enable debugging output
  -p|--include='pat,pat,...': include patterns of files to match (default: '*.py')
  -x|--exclude='pat,pat,...': filepath patterns to ignore (e.g. '*lib/*,secret*.py')
  -s|--process='pat,script': instead of uploading, run `script' on files matching `pat'
  -k|--updelete='pat,pat,..': filepath patterns to delete after uploading
```

`Ctrl-C` to quit.  

## Micropython Application

Micro-controller development can be tedious.  With C-based firmware frameworks, you must:

1. Make a tiny change, perhaps to a single constant in some file
1. Recompile, sometimes many dozens of files [1-30s]
1. Relink the firmware [1-10s]
1. Upload the firmware over Serial [>10s]
1. Wait for microcontroller to reboot and re-run firmware
1. Test your changes

An edit/compile/build/upload "development loop" cycle well over one minute is not atypical. I'd often forget what it was I was testing before an iteration completes.  Painful!

[Micropython](http://micropython.org) greatly simplifies this workflow.  It includes an interactive REPL for testing and development. It's _paste mode_ (`Ctrl-E`) makes it trivial to test small chunks of code.  But for typical projects, you'll often be editing and uploading relatively large Python files (>5K).  In this case, the development loop can _still_ be a somewhat slow process:

1. Make a tiny change, perhaps to a single constant in some file
1. Using a tool like [rshell](https://github.com/dhylands/rshell): `C-x` to exit the REPL, `cp file.py /board` to upload file over serial port [~15-20s for a 25K file at the default baud rate]
1. Wait for microcontroller to reboot (which the rshell `cp` causes), and then reinitialize (perhaps by hand) [1-5s, e.g. for Wifi startup]
1. Test your changes

So this still looks like a 10-30s "development loop" time.  `autoftp` enables a _much faster_ workflow for network-connected microcontrollers:

1. Make a tiny change, perhaps to a single constant
1. File changes are noticed automatically and the file is immediately uploaded to the micro-controller [0.5s for small file, <1s for files <25K]
1. Reload code and test

## Usage Details

Only files are watched and uploaded.  All files _must_ match one of the `-p` wildcard patterns (`*.py` by default), and must _not_ match any of the `-x` exclude pattern(s).  The latter is a good way to omit entire directories, etc.  By default, files are placed in directories relative to the FTP server's working directory (typically the root of the microcontroller).  

If you need to pre-process one file type to produce another, you can use, e.g., `-s '*.suf, process` to run the script `process` on files matching `*.suf`.  `process` is called with the file as its only argument.  This script might produce one or more _other_ output files of different types, which are picked up for transfer, if specified.  If an uploaded file matches any of the `-k` patterns, it will be deleted after upload.  This is useful for files which should be transfered, but don't need to be kept locally.  Note that, since it only operates on _uploaded_ file, `-k` patterns must match files matched by the `-p` patterns to be effective.

An example might be: 

```
% autoftp host.local -p '*.mpy' -s '*.py, mpy-cross' -k '*.mpy'
```

which would auto-compile `.py` files into `.mpy` files and upload them.

N.B. If the files to process are _also_ being uploaded to the host, ensure your processing script does _not_ update the processed file itself, or endless loops will commence.  Script processing occurs before upload.

## Questions

1. **Where does `autoftp` put the files?** FTP servers have a _current working directory_ (mentioned at `autoftp` startup). For a typical installation this will be `/`, the root of your micro-controller's flash.  Files in the directory where `autoftp` is run from go into the current working directory; files in subdirectories go into matching subdirectories (which are created if necessary). 

1. **Won't this wear out the flash?** Unlikely.  Flash is usually written using _wear-leveling_ to spread the writes around, and each cell can support ~100,000 writes without error.  If you edit and re-upload a 5K file (about 150 lines of Python) every 10 seconds 10hrs/day, this works out to 1.3 million writes per year, or just over 1600 full re-writes of a typical (ESP32) 4MB of flash.  At this rate, it would take **62 years** to surpass the 100,000 write limit: a pretty good safety margin.  Another perspective: it takes a fixed number of code/upload/check cycles to bring a project into stability; `autoftp` just accelerates that process. 

1. **Does autoftp delete files remotely?** For safety, file deletions events in the directory path are _not_ mirrored on the FTP server.  With the `--updelete=|-k` option, any matching files _which have been successfully uploaded_ are deleted _locally_.  These are usually temporary files produced by the `-s` script option.

1. **Why not just use an FTP client?** In fact `ncftpput` can automatically find changed files (based on size and modification time) and upload them.  But it adds 1-3s minimum extra overhead as it re-negotiates the FTP connection each time, and you either have to remember which file you were working on, or have it check the remote timestamp of all files (another ~5s or more).  `autoftp` takes all that friction entirely away.  Traditional recursive ftp clients like `ncftpput` are still useful for pre-seeding a file heirarchy from scratch.  And you can easily delete remote files in an interactive FTP session. 

1. **What if the FTP server gets reset?** This can happen for example after a soft-reset.  In that case `autoftp` attempts to reconnect to the FTP server, and proceeds with the transfer.  But rather than soft reset'ing to try out your new script, see below for some other ideas. 

## Tips

## Avoiding soft reset

A simple way of "starting from scratch" is to soft-reset your MicroPython board with `Ctrl-D`.  This has the nice property of re-starting MicroPython with a clean slate without a full hardware boot.  But it also kills off your FTP server, etc.  A better way is to `re-run` your file after uploading it, for example using a simple script (defined in your `main.py`, for example), like:

```python
def unload(mod): 
    mod_name = mod.__name__
    import sys
    if mod_name in sys.modules:
        del sys.modules[mod_name]
    return mod_name

def run(mod):
    name = unload(mod)
    __import__(name)
```

Now you can just let `autoftp` transfer for you, and:

```
>>> run(myGreatModule)
```

## Installing uftpd

[`uftpd.py`](https://github.com/robert-hh/FTP-Server-for-ESP8266-ESP32-and-PYBD) is a small uftpd server which runs in the background waiting for socket connections.  To install, just drop the `uftpd.py` file on your microcontroller (perhaps in the `lib/` subdirectory), and `import` it in your `boot.py`.

### Starting WiFi and `uftpd`

Typical for an ESP32 or related device.

in `boot.py`:
```python
#Start ftp server
import wifi
wifi.start()
import uftpd
```

in `wifi.py`:
```python
# Connect wifi and set host
import time
import network

HOSTNAME="myhost"
SSID='MYSSID'
PASSWORD='MYPASSWD'
wlan = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)

def activate(timeout=10):
    wlan.active(True)
    for _ in range(5):
        try:
            wlan.config(dhcp_hostname=HOSTNAME)
        except OSError:
            time.sleep_ms(500)

    start=time.ticks_ms()
    
    if not wlan.isconnected():
        wlan.connect(SSID,PASSWORD) 
        while not wlan.isconnected():
            time.sleep_ms(150)
            if time.ticks_diff(time.ticks_ms(),start)/1e3 > timeout: break
    
def start(quiet=False,log_callback=None):
    for i in range(1,11):
        if not quiet: print('connecting to network{}...'.
                            format(" [{}]".format(i) if i>1 else ""))
        activate()
        if wlan.isconnected(): break
        if log_callback: log_callback(i)
        time.sleep_ms(500)
    if not wlan.isconnected():
        print("Failed to connect wifi!")
        return(None)

    if not quiet: print(HOSTNAME,'network config:', wlan.ifconfig())
    return(wlan)
```
